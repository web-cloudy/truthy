## Getting Started

This project was created to help developers by bootstrapping basic modules that need to be present while creating a standard CMS. The main motto of this project was to save precious time while developing CMS and focus more on the core part. This project is trying to follow the best possible standard to make it optimized and production-ready. Hope you like it. <br>
If you love it don't forget to share your experience. If you want to contribute to the Truthy CMS in any way like API, Frontend, Design, Logo you're more than welcome to do so. Our plan is to make this no. 1 CMS maintained by opensource community.

```bash
yarn coveralls
```

### `yarn orm-create migration_file_name`

---

## Setup

First, you need to install the project using npx command

```bash
npx truthy-api
```

or clone it using

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gobeam/truthy.git
```
**You also need to run PostgresQL for database and Redis for key-val storage which will be used for queue and throttling.**
After cloning the make changes in configuration file that exists in config folder which exists in root of project.
File names are named in accordance with environment you run project with. For example if you're running project in development environment you should make change in configuration of development.yml file. 
**Please keep in mind environment variables always overrides the config.**

If you want to run locally,
```bash
yarn start
```
*If you want to view swagger docs on development open http://localhost:7777/api-docs (assuming you are running application on 7777 port)*

Run Migration
```bash
yarn migrate
```

Run Seeders
```bash
yarn seed
```

Rollback Migration
```bash
yarn migration:rollback
```

---

## Docker Setup

**If you want to run project without docker you will not need to create .env file**

If you want to use **Docker** to deploy it on production or development stage
First create a .env file copying from .env.example and add environment for below parameters only since it will be used for building container using docker-compose

```env
SERVER_PORT=7777
DB_PASSWORD=root
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_DATABASE_NAME=truthy
DB_PORT=5488
REDIS_PORT=6399
```

After creating env file make changes in configuration in accordance with you development environment. Follow setup guide in case you missed it.
 
Now to run containers do
```bash
docker-compose build .
docker-compose up -d
```
These commands will run 3 containers for PostgresQL, Redis and Main API.

To run migration on docker container
```bash
docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> yarn migrate
```

To run seeder on docker container
```bash
docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> yarn seed
```

## Application Security

### Throttle

By default Throttle has been implemented for all API's. Redis is default driver to record throttle state data. You can easily change configuration from config files.

### Two Factor Authentication (2FA)

User Will have 2FA authentication option available to be turned on or off. For 2FA time-based one-time password is used. A time-based one-time password (TOTP) application automatically generates an authentication code that changes after a certain period of time. Applications like [Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en&gl=US), [1Password](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/), [Authy](https://authy.com/guides/github/) etc. can be used to generate TOTP. When you enable 2FA, you will be sent a QR code in your email which should be scanned from above mentioned application and TOTP will be generated by those applications.
